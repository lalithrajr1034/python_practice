# it is a data type which helps us to store a sequence of charactor 


oper1='abcd'
oper2="abcd"
oper3="""abcd"""

# a='hi lalithraj i am seena's friend'                                          ((to avoid this ve want to see the comas that we are using))  
a="hi lalithraj i am seena's friend" #solution


#i think 
""" this method is best use for string  """



# escape sequence charactor
char1="hi i am lalith\traj \n i am just 18"
print(char1)
      #(or)
print("hi i am lalith\traj \n i am just 18")
