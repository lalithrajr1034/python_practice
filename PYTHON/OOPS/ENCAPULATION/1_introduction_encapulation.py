#Encapsulation is the key feature in Object Oriented Principle of wrapinga data  inside a class and protecting it from direct access.
                                       #(methods and  data (or) attributes )  
                                         #or

#Encapsulation is the process of binding data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class,
#and restricting direct access to some of the object's components to protect the internal state
