#TREE:
  #Tree is a hirerchical, non primitive, non linear data structure it helps to represent a parent and child relationship





















#Brath First Search


#Deapth First Search 
   #In order traversal [7,12,14,15,20,23,27,88]     root node is in middle and left-elements are left and right-elemrnts are right
   #Pre order traversal [15,12,7,14,27,20,23,88]    left subtree is firt then right subtree
   #Post orser traversal [7,14,12,23,20,88,27,15]   right subtree is first then left subtee
